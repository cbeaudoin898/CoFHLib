The intention of the CoFH Common Library is to establish a framework for modders
to use to avoid "reinventing the wheel," as it were. This library contains a lot
of basic functionality that quite a few mods end up adding at some point during
their development.

Ideally, using this library will allow for more rapid mod development as a lot
of the "boring" yet essential code is provided here. Additionally, it has the
potential to greatly reduce permgen space, and who can argue with that?

Obviously, we have to maintain this library and keep it compatible with the
changes and updates introduced by Minecraft and Forge, but we'll try and only
add new things if at all possible.

If you feel that there is anything obvious or very basic that we have missed,
feel free to suggest it to the team.

We look forward to seeing what the community does with this.

Oh, and don't be a jerk.

Extra note:
This is an unoffical port of CoFHLib by myself, running on too much coffee in the space of about 4 hours. I'm working on a port of Minechem and it relies on CoFHLib in a couple of places, so I just decided to port it over myself. Do NOT annoy Team CoFH with any bug reports etc. I claim NO credit for this awesome library - 99% of the code isn't mine, it's the product of the TeamCoFH genius. I've just applied a couple of basic fixes and API updates, nothing more - all rights remain with them, all licenses revert to them, all glory to hypnotoad and whatever else needs to be said so everyone is well aware of my lack of intention towards jerkishness. If they want it taken down for any reason - respect that and don't bombard me with source requests please.

Stuff WILL break. This is an ultra early alpha, nothing more. It compiles, it builds, it seems to provide the API's ok. RF seems to work. Testing in-game seems fine. There WILL be blood, there WILL be tears I'm sure. I've tried to keep all method calls in so porting your 1.17.10 stuff will be minutely less painful. I've added methods for a lot of the player held item stuff to provide for offhand usage, like holding a battery charger in the offhand slot or whatever. Check the (brief) changelog.

Feel free to open any issues you find and I'll work on em when I feel like it. But as mentioned I'm not part of TeamCoFH and this isn't a huge priority of mine. I'll respond when I can. No, I'm NOT working on an unoffical port of TE....I'll need far more coffee to get onto that. Happy modding everyone! :)
